			<p>In 2020, we started Comfy House with a vision - to make a million homes beautiful.
				Our catalogue featured just 8 designs. Yet, when our customers shared
				photographs of their homes, we saw they were remarkably distinct. The same table, the
				same chair was used differently by different people. This told us something. People
				want their homes to be unique. We also realized that people are a lot happier creating
				things than they are buying things. We are a creative, imaginative, expressive species.
				And our homes are just one of the many canvases we have at our disposal.
				
				Today, we understand that we’re here not just to sell well-designed products. We’re
				here to help you create spaces that mirror who you are. At Comfy House, we want you
				to discover the joy of creating. Starting with your home. We want you to think of the
				setting up of a space as an energizing, creative pursuit. To breathe life into empty
				rooms with your ideas. To take a few square feet of nothing, and transform it into
				something beautiful.</p>
